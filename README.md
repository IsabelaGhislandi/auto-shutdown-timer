# Auto Shutdown Timer
This project allows users to set an automatic shutdown timer for their computer, with three preset options: 1 hour, 2 hours, and 3 hours. I created this tool out of personal necessityâ€”to help my computer shut down automatically after watching movies at night, as I often fall asleep before they finish.

## Features
Time Selection: Allows the user to choose from three shutdown durations:

1 hour
2 hours
3 hours
Automatic Shutdown: The computer will automatically shut down after the selected time, helping save energy and prolong device life.

How to Use
Choose a Duration: Select one of the three timer options.
Start the Timer: The program will begin the countdown and shut down the computer after the specified time.
Motivation
Designed to make automatic shutdown easier, this project is perfect for those who, like me, enjoy watching movies at night and often fall asleep ðŸ˜…, unable to turn off the computer once the movie ends.

After that, my laptop got to experience being shut down. ðŸ’»ðŸ˜´
