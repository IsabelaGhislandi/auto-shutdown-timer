# Auto Shutdown Timer
This is a Python program that allows users to set an automatic shutdown timer for their computer with three preset options: 1 hour, 2 hours, and 3 hours. Created with a personal need in mind, it helps the computer shut down automatically after watching movies at night, as I often fall asleep before they finish.

## Features
Time Selection: Allows the user to choose from three shutdown durations:

1 hour
2 hours
3 hours
Automatic Shutdown: The computer will automatically shut down after the selected time, helping save energy and prolong device life.

## How to Use
Choose a Duration: Select one of the three timer options.
Start the Timer: The program will begin the countdown and shut down the computer after the specified time.

## Planned Improvements
I plan to enhance this program by adding a feature that detects when a video file is opened. The program would then retrieve the videoâ€™s duration and prompt the user to confirm if they would like the computer to shut down after the video ends.

## Motivation
Designed to make automatic shutdown easier, this project is perfect for those who, like me, enjoy watching movies at night and often fall asleep ðŸ˜…, unable to turn off the computer once the movie ends.

After that, my laptop got to experience being shut down. ðŸ’»ðŸ˜´
